title: The State of Search Engine Marketing in India
---

You thought I was busy with something all this while? - Yup ! Here is
what it was all about \> A Report on The State of Search Engine
Marketing in India About the report from Pinstorm - News channel This
report is a first-of-its-kind in the field of Search Engine Marketing
(SEM) business. You can expect to find some very interesting data,
comparisons & revelations here.

-   Find out where the SEM industry in India stands today.
-   What sectors are hot.
-   How much the key players in every sector are spending- Naukri vs
    Monster, HP vs Dell, Shaadi vs Jeevansathi. You name it, we have it.
-   Are other players catching up with the giant eBay in the retail
    market?

Some coOL, funny and interesting tit-bits straight from the report: Rs.
230 crores of ad spend on this media is aimed at Indians alone. Of this,
about a third, over Rs. 70 crores is spent by Indian companies. For an
industry that barely got off the ground a couple of years ago, it’s a
huge leap. A note of thanks. An enterprise of this scale wouldn’t have
been possible without the help of some very smart people. A big hand to
Dr. V. Vinay, Pinstorm’s technology guru (with flowing locks to match)
who wrote much of the code and algorithms to make these calculations
possible. A doff of the hat to [Akshay Surve][], Ansoo Gupta, Hanisha
Vaswani, Harish TM, Indrojit Chaudhuri, Milan Zaveri, Netra Parikh,
Nikhil Sheth, Ratan KK and Reshma Nayak - some of the other Pinstormers
who temporarily gave up sleep and sanity to make this report happen. And
to the redoubtable Subho Ray of the IAMAI, Doc, here’s to making history
together! Delhi is more expensive than Bangalore, which is more
expensive than Mumbai. But only in search marketing terms. So, here we
are, many nights, many cups of Barista coffee, Punjab Sweet House
samosas and Snack Shack sali botis, many lines of code and charts on
Excel later. You can download the report for free ;-) from [here][].
