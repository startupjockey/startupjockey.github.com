Have been following Ruby and Ruby on Rails(RoR) for some time now. Today
(in the last 24 hours) I finally treid it out live at the [hackathon][].
Ruby is coOL and Ruby on Rails is even coOLer! Like there is no smoke
without fire… RoR really stands up to the hype (wateva) around it. I
also liked the whole concept of a hackathon. Cheers to [Better Labs][]
for initiating it and hearty congratulations for its success. ~~More
about it later…~~ Hey I was selected as the SiLver Hacker at the
[hackathon][1] after the evaluations ! Cheers !!! I built a planet
application using Ruby on Rails in 36 hours and named it Mars (any
guesses y ?). You can know more about it [here][]. I guess I was waiting
for a excuse (?) to start using RoR. Now I am sure its going to be a
MaRaThoN run with ruby for company.
