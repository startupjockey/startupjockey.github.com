title: Pretty GNU Emacs with XFT goodness
---

I have been using Emacs for most of my ruby and rails programming. I
tend to like it and now I can say that I am an Emacs addict. A week back
I stumbled upon this article [Pretty Emacs][] while search for some
popular themes for Emacs. I tried installing Emacs from the repositories
but the installation was never successful. Later I also followed posts
[GNU Emacs with XFT goodness][] and [Emacs font joy][]. Finally, I have
it working(most probably) and here is my screenshot: [![emacs][]][]
Looks Yummy! isnâ€™t it?
